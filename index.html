		<div>This point of observation fills in for and contributes to the broader conversations my collages depict in the areas of further learning, new insight acquisition, and a search for a deeper sense of comprehension needed on my part.

Further, it carries all the primary lesions different communities, aspects of societie's past and present, and the joy a camera has brought to me. It also serves to remind me of the conversations, the current societal norms, and the traditions that do not make a lot of sense to me at present: Things that, if applied differently by all parties involved, could prevent a relapse of the depression and anxiety I still live with to the degree it has affected me in the past.</div>

		<div>I have chosen this image to represent me in the positive experiences throughout this book. The conversations this aspect of me is involved in are full of hope, a learned wisdom, and compassion a few others have taught me in a world that still struggles to understand and accept me. Below are some examples of this aspect of calm in what might otherwise be a stern conversation.

Michael's hope says: Equity when viewed from some locations offers hope that struggles will end. However, others when in these situations become entrapped. Stigma, why is it that you always dash collective dreams and take great joy in other people's misery?

Michael's hope says: He wishes to interact with the world in such a way that his uniqueness is an asset, not the liability, Stigma you make it out to be? Society is this how you think you can make him or her feel safe all the time?

Michael's hope One says: One day Michael will find others who value connection based on meaning far deeper than only shared values. This relationship will form when other equally important relationships lift the veil that Stigma, Society, Anxiety and Depression force him to live through. Further, he will be encouraged to develop meaning in his life again after misdiagnosis, and multiple learning challenges robbed him of all hope.</div>
		<div>Rowboat
Observation point
</div>
		<div>I have chosen this mode of transportation to help me illustrate one of th two current types of experience that fill my life.

This primitive manual method of propulsion in contrast to the motorized methods used by the society around me symbolizes my communication difficulties.

Although I feel ignored when in this mode of transport, I am grateful for the abilities of this boat to allow for ample time to comprehend, plan for, and learn about impending transitions so they can go smoothly.

One of the major drawbacks of this mode of transportation is that it does not provide a lot of shelter from the discomforting experiences that I had "floating in the water."</div>
		<div>This reflection of my small boat is made up of stigma, ostracizing social norms, depression, anxiety, and other related intense negative feelings.

These strong feelings are associated with people or organizations with whom I interact who are clueless about invisible disabilities. This enables inequality to flourish.</div>
		<div>This image represents both the ways relationships of immense value to me and my frustrations and great struggle with differences in the communications needs of the parties involved. These differences stress our relationships. Further, they fill a spot in other people's heated conversation where thoughtfullness compassion and trust are more present than I have experienced in society. An example of statements this image might make in a dialogue appears below.

Valued relationship says: Norms further stigmatize those with an invisible disability. Society and Stigma why is it that the two of you are so insistent that each of you booth alternately prevent these valued relationships from forming in the first place? Make them so superficial that what those with an invisible disability think they may be able to count on these other parties who turn out to be toxic.</div>
		<div>I chose this series of reflections to create part of the boat hull to help illustrate how careful reflection on the past help me to learn about the future.

Further, these observations fill in for kinds of knowledge that others who interact with me think I may or may not already have. To that end, they also represent the tensions in any potential conversations I am involved in that have nothing to do with the events of the present moment.

For me, it is necessary to have an active link to events in my personal history as well as the history of the region I choose to call home. I can attempt to do my small part to prevent a superficial interpretation or otherwise repetition of events that did not work out well for the parties involved.</div>
		<div>These images represent qualities of light that form a beacon of hope by which I attempt to navigate life.

They are two of the biggest silent aspects of the struggle that is my current lived experience. They always offer me the opportunity to learn in a safe environment and gain valuable new perspectives through my observations and direct interactions.

I value the degrees to which they offer me shelter from the not always pleasant conversations I am a part of. I am grateful for the chance they afford me to provide safe alternatives to explain myself to others. This is one of the direct benefits of my use of my collage as a form of expression.</div>
